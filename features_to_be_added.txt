do I need each button to have a taskId? - I need to know what object to delete

- create like a placeholder task and display it in the beginning (kind of done - recheck)

- add a functionality to be able to open the form with the "CTRL" button (done)

- re-do the renderTasks() function and make it render based on a given array (done)

- add a button that will mark the day as completed
	- the newDay object should have the completed set 	to true when "mark as completed" is pressed
	- the day number should be incremented in ascending 	order
	- save the completedDays to localStorage and read 	from there when the app is loaded
	- after the day is marked as completed, wipe out 	everything and just display a congratulations 	message
	- I should be able to mark the day as completed 	once?

- the day in the left sidebar should contain the date --> 
Day 29th of September 2024
