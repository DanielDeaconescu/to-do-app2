do I need each button to have a taskId? - I need to know what object to delete

- create like a placeholder task and display it in the beginning (kind of done - recheck)

- add a functionality to be able to open the form with the "CTRL" button (done)

- re-do the renderTasks() function and make it render based on a given array (done)

- the day in the left sidebar should contain the date --> 
Day 29th of September 2024
